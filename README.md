# Stock Market  Prediction
 Stock Future Predictor  The Stock Future Predictor is an advanced web application designed to help users forecast future stock prices using historical data and cutting-edge machine learning models. This tool is particularly useful for traders, investors, and anyone interested in predicting stock market trends.  Key Features User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.  Stock Data Input: Users can input any valid stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) to retrieve and analyze historical stock data starting from January 1, 2010.  Data Visualization: The app provides multiple visualizations to help users understand historical trends:  Closing Price vs. Time: A chart displaying the stock's closing prices over time. Moving Averages: Visualizations of 100-day and 200-day moving averages overlaid on the closing price chart to identify long-term trends. Machine Learning Predictions:  Pre-trained TensorFlow Model: The app uses a pre-trained model to predict future stock prices based on past data. Comparison: It compares the predicted prices with actual prices to evaluate the model's accuracy. Forecasting with Prophet:  The app uses Facebook's Prophet model to forecast stock prices for up to four years into the future. This powerful time series model is particularly effective for handling daily observations and predicting trends over longer periods. Interactive Forecast Plot: The app provides an interactive Plotly chart of the forecasted prices, allowing users to explore the predicted trends easily. Forecast Components: Users can also view the underlying components of the forecast, such as trend and seasonality, to better understand the driving factors behind the predictions. Technologies Used Python: The core programming language used to develop the application. Streamlit: For building the web interface. TensorFlow & Keras: For training and using the machine learning model. Prophet: For time series forecasting. Plotly: For interactive data visualizations. YFinance: For retrieving stock data from Yahoo Finance. Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations. Matplotlib: For plotting static charts. Purpose This project aims to provide an accessible and powerful tool for stock price prediction. By leveraging machine learning and advanced statistical models, it offers users a way to anticipate future market movements, helping them make more informed investment decisions.  Installation & Setup Users can easily set up the application by cloning the repository, installing the necessary dependencies via requirements.txt, and running the app using Streamlit. The app is designed to run locally on a user's machine, offering a seamless experience for anyone looking to predict stock prices.
